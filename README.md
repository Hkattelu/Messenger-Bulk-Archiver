# Messenger-Bulk-Archiver

Bulk-Archiver is a tool for Archiving conversations on Facebook messenger.
Archiving a chat removes it from the view, but keeps searchable so that
your messages aren't lost, but you get to remove clutter. There is no
way to bulk archive conversations on facebook messenger currently, so this
removes the hassle of having to manually click through each conversation
to archive it.

You should install this extension and if:
  * You dislike the clutter of having a lot of messages in your app
  * You chat too much, and want to make it harder for yourself to message others
  * You want to clean up years of conversations without having to manually archive

In order to install the install, download this repo and go [here](chrome://extensions).
Enable developer mode and load the folder containing this code as an unpacked extension.
You should then be able to run it on messenger.com.

## Feature Backlog

  * Create a menu that to select conversations to NOT archive
  * Create a tool to bulk un-archive
